# Blockchain project

Single file project written in Python that I did during a Blockchain course.
This was helpful for me to acquire the main Blockchain concepts.
It runs on a local Flask server and it can be used trough Postman doing request to some endpoints.

## Disclaimer

**I'm not the author of this app**. I just followed the tutorial to learn the concepts and practice python.
This project is part of the awesome course [_Curso Completo de Blockchain de cero a experto_](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-de-blockchain-de-la-a-a-la-z/) by **Joan Amengual** and **Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas**. It's in spanish :)

## Test this app

Prerequisites: You will need python and postman to be installed in your pc.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Execute blockchain.py using the run button in VisualStudio Code, or in the command line:

3. In postman import the collection from [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/8a803fe0e8f7810867ba)
